Incidental Assignments
----------------------

In the first few weeks students will bring in examples of humor across media platforms that they find funny. These examples will be viewed / read / listened to and discussed in class. Students may also be required to bring in material and complete short writing assignments over the course of the semester. These contributions and short form exercises will count toward your participation grade.

Project Assignments (Complete 3 of 10)
--------------------------------------

Over the course of the semester students will complete THREE of the TEN assignments that are listed in the table below alongside each week’s unit of study. Students will choose their projects by the end of the fifth week. At least one of these pieces must be collaborative. All projects will be workshopped in class – the schedule for which we will determine once we begin.

Counterfactual Comedy
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Write and produce a 5 minute piece of counterfactual comedy in the style of one of the comics viewed for this week. Your subject should be topical in nature and should be two or more of the following: a set up, framing the your topic in a journalistic fashion; a cut-away to a correspondent reporting on the issue; an interview with either a distinguished faculty member or concerned citizen (these may be scripted and staged or “gonzo” style) and other elements we will come up with in class. All projects should end with a 2 page assessment of the project after it has been discussed and screened in the class.

Mockumentary

_Note: This unit is optional and may be done in concert with or in place of Week 12’s unit on counterfactual comedy_


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Write and produce a 6–8 minute mockumentary on a subject of your choosing. Perhaps what separates the mockumentary from the counterfactual comedy is what separates the daily news from in-depth or long form journalism. Like long form journalism, your mockumentary should be a well-researched and detailed portrait of a person, object, idea or event. If it helps to parody a specific documentary, that would be fine. Mockumentary projects will be work-shopped in class, screened in the final class and should be followed up with a 2 page written assessment of the project.

Create and edit a podcast on a topic of your choice, interviewing at least one guest (8 minutes total.) As an interviewer you may be “in-character” or “yourself.” Your interviewees should be real people. Interviews should be related to a specific subject and your interview should be crafted for comedic effect.
